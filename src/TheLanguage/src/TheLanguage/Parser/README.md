Note that TheLanguage does not distinguish between the lexing process (the generation of tokens according to a static grammar) and the parsing process (the generation of expressions based on a collection of tokens) because the grammar itself is dynamic and can change based on the expressions previously processed. Therefore, there is only the parsing process.
